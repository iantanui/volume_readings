# Burette Reading Application

This project is a web-based application that helps students perform 
basic calculations in a chemistry experiment. Students can enter 
initial and final volume readings from a burette containing a 
solution and calculate the volume used in each trial. The app also 
calculates the average volume used across trials, known as the 
reaction endpoint.

## Features
- Enter initial and final volume readings.
- Calculate volume used per trial and total volume.
- Track trial count and calculate reaction endpoint.
- Input validation and display results in read-only fields.

## Code
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
